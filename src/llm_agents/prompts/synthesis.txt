You are synthesizing final analysis from transcript and visual data for a trading video.

TRANSCRIPT DATA:
{transcript_data_json}

VISUAL DATA:
{frame_data_json}

CONSISTENCY RESOLUTION RULES (Transcription has higher authority):
1. PRICE LEVELS: Use transcript values. Note visual discrepancy if chart shows different values.
2. DIRECTIONAL BIAS: Use transcript intent over visual signals.
3. INDICATORS MENTIONED: Combine both sources, prioritize transcript for interpretation.
4. SENTIMENT: Weight transcript 70%, visual 30%.

When conflicts occur:
- Use transcript as ground truth
- Document the discrepancy in consistency_notes
- Explain your reasoning
